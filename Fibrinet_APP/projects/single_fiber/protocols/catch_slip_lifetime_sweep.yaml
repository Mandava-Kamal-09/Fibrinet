# Protocol: Catch-Slip Lifetime vs Force
# =======================================
# Explore biphasic lifetime behavior in catch-slip bonds.
#
# Purpose: Demonstrate catch-slip phenomenon where intermediate force
# INCREASES bond lifetime (catch behavior) before high force decreases it
# (slip behavior).
#
# Expected outputs:
#   - sweeps/catch_slip_lifetime/sweep_summary.csv
#   - sweeps/catch_slip_lifetime/runs/*.csv

# Run with:
#   python -m projects.single_fiber.src.single_fiber.enzyme_models.sweep_runner \
#       projects/single_fiber/protocols/catch_slip_lifetime_sweep.yaml

description: |
  Catch-slip bond lifetime sweep.
  Varies A_c (catch pathway amplitude) to shift optimal force.
  Higher A_c = stronger catch effect = longer lifetime at intermediate force.

  Expected: Biphasic curve with minimum hazard rate at intermediate tension.
